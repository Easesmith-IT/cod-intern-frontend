          At CodIntern, we think that excellent mentors are the first step
          toward great learning. Our knowledgeable instructors are more than
          just instructors; they are tech executives, professionals in the
          field, and seasoned educators with practical project management
          experience from top businesses. Every live session benefits from their
          extensive subject knowledge, real-world perspectives, and enthusiasm
          for teaching.

        <p className="font-stolzl text-xs sm:text-sm text-para max-w-[869px] mt-3 font-book">
          Our live classes are incredibly engaging, interactive, and created to
          mimic actual work environments. Every session, whether it's about
          project management, coding, or career preparation, is practical,
          results-oriented, and in line with industry standards. Students can
          work with peers, ask questions in real time, and get tailored feedback
          that helps them grasp concepts more quickly.
        </p>
        <p className="font-stolzl text-xs sm:text-sm text-para max-w-[869px] mt-3 font-book">
          Additionally, we offer round-the-clock assistance via our dedicated
          help channels because we understand that learning never ends. Our
          mentor network and support staff are always available by message, so
          you never have to learn alone, whether you're having trouble with an
          assignment, need technical help, or simply want career advice.
